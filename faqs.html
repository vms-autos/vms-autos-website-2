    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <details class="faq"><summary>Do you offer finance?</summary><p>Yes — we work with trusted lenders to offer flexible HP/PCP options (subject to status). We’ll talk through monthly payments and deposit choices to keep things clear.</p></details>
    <details class="faq"><summary>Can I part-exchange my current car?</summary><p>Absolutely. Share your reg, mileage and a few photos and we’ll provide a fair valuation. You can use it against any vehicle in stock.</p></details>
    <details class="faq"><summary>Can I reserve a car?</summary><p>Yes — a small refundable holding deposit removes the car from sale while we arrange viewing and paperwork.</p></details>
    <details class="faq"><summary>Do you take cars on sale-or-return?</summary><p>We do. We handle marketing, enquiries and viewings, and transfer the funds to you once sold.</p></details>
    <details class="faq"><summary>What checks do you perform?</summary><p>Each vehicle is inspected and road-tested. History and mileage checks are performed for your peace of mind.</p></details>
    <details class="faq"><summary>Where are you based? Do you offer delivery?</summary><p>We’re UK-based and can arrange nationwide delivery at cost. Get in touch for a tailored quote.</p></details>
